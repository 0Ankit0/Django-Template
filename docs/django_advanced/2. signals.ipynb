    "## Signals\n",
    "In Django, signals are a way to allow decoupled applications to get notified when certain actions occur elsewhere in the framework. They are especially useful for triggering actions in response to events such as model saves, deletions, or user logins.\n",
    "The signals are implemented using the `django.dispatch` module, which provides a way to create and manage signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal methods name usually follow the pattern of `<model>_<action>`, where `<model>` is the name of the model and `<action>` is the event that triggers the signal (e.g., `pre_save`, `post_save`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used signals in Django include:\n",
    "1. `pre_save` and `post_save`: Sent before or after a model's `save()` method is called.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from django.db.models.signals import pre_save, post_save\n",
    "    from django.dispatch import receiver\n",
    "    from myapp.models import MyModel\n",
    "    @receiver(pre_save, sender=MyModel)\n",
    "    def mymodel_pre_save(sender, instance, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Code to execute before saving MyModel instance\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    @receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)\n",
    "    def mymodel_post_save(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Code to execute after saving MyModel instance\n",
    "        if created:\n",
    "            # Code for newly created instance\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. `pre_delete` and `post_delete`: Sent before or after a model's `delete()` method is called.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from django.db.models.signals import pre_delete, post_delete\n",
    "    from django.dispatch import receiver\n",
    "    from myapp.models import MyModel\n",
    "    @receiver(pre_delete, sender=MyModel)\n",
    "    def mymodel_pre_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Code to execute before deleting MyModel instance\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    @receiver(post_delete, sender=MyModel)\n",
    "    def mymodel_post_delete(sender, instance, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Code to execute after deleting MyModel instance\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. `m2m_changed`: Sent when a ManyToManyField is changed.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from django.db.models.signals import m2m_changed\n",
    "    from django.dispatch import receiver\n",
    "    from myapp.models import MyModel\n",
    "    @receiver(m2m_changed, sender=MyModel.my_many_to_many_field.through)\n",
    "    def mymodel_m2m_changed(sender, instance, action, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Code to execute when ManyToManyField changes\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. `request_started` and `request_finished`: Sent when a request starts and finishes.This signal is applied to the entire Django application, not just a specific model or app and is useful for logging or monitoring purposes.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from django.core.signals import request_started, request_finished\n",
    "    from django.dispatch import receiver\n",
    "    @receiver(request_started)\n",
    "    def request_started_handler(sender, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Code to execute when a request starts\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    @receiver(request_finished)\n",
    "    def request_finished_handler(sender, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Code to execute when a request finishes\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication Signals\n",
    "Django also provides signals related to user authentication, such as:\n",
    "1. `user_logged_in`: Sent when a user logs in.\n",
    "2. `user_logged_out`: Sent when a user logs out.\n",
    "3. `user_login_failed`: Sent when a login attempt fails.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from django.contrib.auth.signals import user_logged_in, user_logged_out, user_login_failed\n",
    "    from django.dispatch import receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "    @receiver(user_logged_in)\n",
    "    def user_logged_in_handler(sender, request, user, **kwargs):\n",
    "        # Code to execute when a user logs in\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @receiver(user_logged_out)\n",
