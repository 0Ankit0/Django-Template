    "Deep dive on middlewares are covered in the django_advanced/middleware.ipynb file.\n",
    "Here we mainly focus on the middlewares that are provided by django_rest_framework package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Middlewares in Django REST Framework\n",
    "Django REST Framework (DRF) provides several built-in middleware components that enhance the functionality of Django applications, particularly for building APIs. Some of the key middlewares provided by DRF include:\n",
    "1. **Authentication Middleware**: DRF includes middleware for handling authentication mechanisms, such as token-based authentication, session authentication, and more. This middleware processes incoming requests to authenticate users based on the provided credentials.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication, SessionAuthentication\n",
    "\n",
    "   class MyAuthenticationMiddleware:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, get_response):\n",
    "           self.get_response = get_response\n",
    "           self.authenticators = [TokenAuthentication(), SessionAuthentication()]\n",
    "   \n",
    "       def __call__(self, request):\n",
    "           for authenticator in self.authenticators:\n",
    "               user_auth_tuple = authenticator.authenticate(request)\n",
    "               if user_auth_tuple is not None:\n",
    "                   request.user, request.auth = user_auth_tuple\n",
    "                   break\n",
    "           return self.get_response(request)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   You can create custom middleware similar to above example or just use the built-in authentication classes directly in your views or viewsets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication\n",
    "   from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated\n",
    "   from rest_framework.views import APIView\n",
    "   class MyAPIView(APIView):\n",
    "       authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication]\n",
    "       permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]\n",
    "   \n",
    "       def get(self, request):\n",
    "           # Your view logic here\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Throttling Middleware**: DRF provides middleware for rate limiting API requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. This middleware can be configured to limit the number of requests a user can make within a specified time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle\n",
    "   class MyThrottleMiddleware:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, get_response):\n",
    "           self.get_response = get_response\n",
    "           self.throttle = UserRateThrottle()\n",
    "   \n",
    "       def __call__(self, request):\n",
    "           if not self.throttle.allow_request(request, None):\n",
    "             from rest_framework.exceptions import Throttled\n",
    "             raise Throttled(detail=\"Request limit exceeded.\")\n",
    "           return self.get_response(request)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "You can also apply throttling directly in your views or viewsets using the `throttle_classes` attribute.For defining the max number of requests allowed, you can set it in the settings file like below:\n"

    "3. **Content Negotiation Middleware**: This middleware helps in determining the appropriate content type for the response based on the client's request headers. It allows the API to serve different formats (e.g., JSON, XML) based on client preferences.\n",

    "           return self.get_response(request)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   You can implement custom content negotiation middleware as shown above or use DRF's built-in content negotiation classes directly in your views.\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   from rest_framework.renderers import JSONRenderer, BrowsableAPIRenderer\n",

    "              # Your view logic here\n",
    "              pass\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. **Exception Handling Middleware**: DRF provides middleware for handling exceptions that occur during request processing. This middleware can catch exceptions and return appropriate HTTP responses with error details.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from rest_framework.views import exception_handler\n",
    "\n",
    "   class MyExceptionHandlingMiddleware:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, get_response):\n",
    "           self.get_response = get_response\n",
    "\n",
    "       def __call__(self, request):\n",
    "           response = self.get_response(request)\n",
    "           return response\n",
    "\n",
    "       def process_exception(self, request, exception):\n",
    "           response = exception_handler(exception, None)\n",
    "           if response is not None:\n",
    "               return response\n",
    "           return None\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   You can also use DRF's built-in exception handling directly in your views or globally in your settings.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   REST_FRAMEWORK = {\n",
    "       'EXCEPTION_HANDLER': 'rest_framework.views.exception_handler',\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "These middlewares can be added to your Django project's middleware stack by including them in the `MIDDLEWARE` setting in your `settings.py` file. However, note that many of these functionalities are often implemented directly in views or viewsets rather than as traditional middleware components.\n"
